Features implemented

A. Game Played Difficulty
       a.Each time I play a game, I want to be able to select a difficulty level for that specific game play.
           1.If I select "normal" I want the scores required to earn an achievement level be 100% of the usual amount.
           2.If I select "easy" I want the scores required to earn an achievement level be 75% of the usual amount.
           3.If I select "hard" I want the scores required to earn an achievement level be 125% of the usual amount.
           4.When viewing an achievement screen, I want to see the difficulty level listed on the screen.
           5.When viewing the list of games played, I want to see the difficulty level listed for each game play.
B. Achievement Improvements
        a.When a game is played and an achievement level is earned, I want an image, some animation effect, and a sound to be played to make it
        feel like a reward and a celebration.
        b.I want to select a theme for the achievements. I want at least 3 different themes to choose between.
          1.It's up to you what themes to support, but possible ones might be: cute fantasy creatures, powerful fantasy creatures, dinosaurs, a
            movie, or (kids) TV show.
          2.I don't want the theme to be specific to any given game configuration, or to a specific game played, but rather be used when I'm
             viewing the achievements (such as viewing achievement levels, or recording a game play).
C.Edit Game Played
       a.When viewing a previous game play, I'd like to be able to edit it to correct any errors, such as changing scores or difficulty so that
          I can correct any errors from previous game plays.
D.Friendly UI
       a.Make the UI friendly and good looking so that it is more appealing to use.
       b.Perhaps adding background images, or customizing the font or buttons.
E.Score Calculator
       a.When recording a game play, change the screen to allow the user to enter each player's score individually so that I don't have to add
         it up in my head when I'm playing with multiple players.
       b.The app must ask how many players there are and then allow me to enter each player's score individually.
       c.The app should know the individual scores in the future, so that I can later go back and see or edit the individual scores.
       d.The computation for the achievement level is still based on the sum of all player scores.
       e.There is no need to identify which players are which; I just want to enter and view the scores of each player.
F.Development Process
       a.Team must implement JUnit unit tests for at least one class in the model.
       b.Team must estimate the work required for 5-6 user stores. In a text file in the docs/ folder, state on one line per user store state:
          1.Brief description of the user story
          2.The estimated amount of work for that story
          3.Include a mention of what your team used as a unit of 1 work.
          4.Team must take notes in meetings; rotate who takes notes. No need to submit proof of this.
